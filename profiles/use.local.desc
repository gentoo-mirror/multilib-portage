app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-db:nodep - Disable the implicit dependency on app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-baselibs found in the gentoo-x86 version of this emul package.
app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-gstplugins:development - Install pkg-config files (a no-op for multilib-portage-provided app-emulation packages which unconditionally install development files).
app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-gstplugins:nodep - Disable all dependencies this package has on other packages as a quick kludge for when the 32-bit app doesnâ€™t actually need every single gstplugin installed.
app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-soundlibs:nodep - Disable the implicit dependency on app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-baselibs found in the gentoo-x86 version of this emul package.
media-sound/jack-audio-connection-kit:coreaudio - Build the CoreAudio driver on Mac OS X systems
media-sound/jack-audio-connection-kit:cpudetection - Enables runtime cpudetection
media-sound/jack-audio-connection-kit:pam - Add basic realime configuration via sys-auth/realtime-base
sci-geosciences/googleearth:qt-bundled - Use bundled Qt4 libraries instead of system ones. Recommended only for troubleshooting.
sys-apps/portage:apidoc - Build html API documentation with sphinx-apidoc.
sys-apps/portage:gentoo-dev - Enable features required for Gentoo ebuild development.
sys-apps/portage:ipc - Use inter-process communication between portage and running ebuilds.
sys-apps/portage:native-extensions - Compiles native "C" extensions (speedups, instead of using python backup code). Currently includes libc-locales. This should only be temporarily disabled for some bootstrapping operations. Cross-compilation is not supported.
sys-apps/portage:rsync-verify - Enable full-tree cryptographic verification of Gentoo repository rsync checkouts using app-portage/gemato.
sys-apps/portage:xattr - Preserve extended attributes (filesystem-stored metadata) when installing files. Usually only required for hardened systems.
x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers:X - Install the X.org driver, OpenGL libraries, XvMC libraries, and VDPAU libraries
x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers:gtk2 - Install nvidia-settings with support for GTK+ 2
x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers:gtk3 - Install nvidia-settings with support for GTK+ 3
x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers:pax_kernel - PaX patches from the PaX project
x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers:tools - Install additional tools such as nvidia-settings
x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers:uvm - Install the Unified Memory kernel module (nvidia-uvm) for sharing memory between CPU and GPU in CUDA programs
